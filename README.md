# Minimal-Polynomial
one possible algorithm to calculate the minimal polynomial of a matrix

For a square matrix belongs to Mn(F), there must be some polynomials which belong to F[t]\{0} can make it be the zero matrix, and we call these polynomials "annihilator polynomials of square matrix A". This means that if you put A into these polynomials to replace the original undetermined element, you will get the zero matrix.
We can prove that there must be a polynomial which belongs to the set of annihilator polynomials of square matrix A has the lowest degree and the coefficient of its term which has the highest degree is 1, and we call this polynomial "the minimal polynomial of square matrix A".
